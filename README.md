# APIs Lab! 

## Introduction

  APIs are a powerful way for us to use publicly available datasets to enhance the functionality of our apps! The goal of this lab is for you to practice researching and using an API with which you are unfamilar, and use it to create an app!
  
## Instructions

Choose one of the APIs below. Use the endpoint and documentation to create an app! 

## Google Books

  ### The Task: 
  Create a webpage that uses the Google Books API to search for basic book information by author, keyword, etc.

  #### Sample Endpoint
  
    https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=rupi+kaur
  
  #### Documentation
  
    https://developers.google.com/books/
    
  #### Bonus
  
* Apply for an API Key and figure out how to use it to gain additional access to book information. 

* Use Materialize to style the page.

## Github

  ### The Task: 
  Create a webpage that uses the Github API to search for an individual user, and output their name, picture, and username to the screen. 

  #### Sample Endpoint

    https://api.github.com/users/twant

  #### Documentation

    https://developer.github.com/v3/users/

  #### Bonus

* Output the number of repositories, and make their picture link to their Github profile page
  
* Use Materialize to style the page
  
## Makeup 

  ### The Task: 
Create a webpage that uses the Makeup API to search for all of the products from a particular brand. Output the picture, name, and price of the    first product returned by the API.

  #### Sample Endpoint

    http://makeup-api.herokuapp.com/api/v1/products.json?brand=maybelline

  #### Documentation

    http://makeup-api.herokuapp.com/

  #### Bonus

* Figure out how to search by brand and product type (so that it would only return mascaras by Maybelline, for example). You could use this idea to search by as many of the parameters listed in the documentation as you would like. 
  
* Use iteration to output information about all of the products returned by the API.
  
* Use Materialize to style the page
